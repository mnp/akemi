akemi window manager
===
Akemi is the cutest window manager around!
Akemi creates a virtual filesystem to represent currently open windows, similar to what /proc does for processes. This allows you to arrange them using any language you like, in a true unix fashion.

Thanks to:
Kori (http://github.com/kori) for suggesting the idea
The creators of wmutils (http://github.com/wmutils/core) for providing some inspiration, and some basic xcb code to study.
